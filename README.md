# Reinforcement-Learning-in-Snake

Snake is a famous video game that originated in the 1976 arcade game Blockade. The player uses up, down, left and right to control the snake which grows in length (when it eats the food pellet), with the snake body and walls around the environment being the primary obstacle. In this project, we trained an AI agent using reinforcement learning to play a simple version of the game Snake. We implemented a TD version of the Q-learning algorithm.

The external libraries required for this project are `numpy` and `pygame`. To play the game yourself and get acquainted with it, you can run

`python mp6.py --human`
